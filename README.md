This repository demonstrates a common pitfall in C++ when using std::vector<bool>. The specialized implementation of std::vector<bool> can lead to unexpected behavior with iterators, potentially causing subtle bugs. The example code shows how using standard algorithms like std::find can fail to work correctly. The solution demonstrates a workaround: using std::vector<int> or std::vector<char> as substitutes.
